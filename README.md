## Acknowledgements

This project, rotten-korean-romanizer, was conceptualized and implemented with the assistance of AI language models, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. These AI models provided guidance on the algorithm design, code structure, and implementation details.

While the core logic and implementation were developed through interactions with AI, all code has been reviewed, tested, and refined by human developers to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.

We believe in transparency about the use of AI in software development. This acknowledgement serves to highlight the collaborative nature of modern software development, where AI tools can augment human creativity and problem-solving skills.

Please note that while AI assistance was invaluable in this project's creation, the final responsibility for the code, its functionality, and any potential issues lies with the human developers maintaining this repository.

We encourage users and contributors to approach this project with both appreciation for AI's capabilities and awareness of its limitations. Your feedback, contributions, and improvements are always welcome to make this tool more accurate and useful for the community.
